ASDK Documentation Home
======================

Welcome to the official documentation for the ASDK (Application Software Development Kit).

ASDK is an embedded development platform designed to simplify application development across multiple microcontroller architectures. It provides a unified API and build system, enabling developers to write portable, microcontroller-agnostic applications.

Key Features:
- Platform abstraction for easy portability
- Comprehensive peripheral and middleware support
- Modular architecture for scalable projects
- Detailed API documentation and code examples
- Guides for both users and developers

In this documentation, you will find:
- **Getting Started**: Step-by-step instructions to set up your environment and build your first project.
- **User Guides**: Practical guides for using ASDK features and integrating with hardware.
- **Developer Guides**: In-depth resources for extending ASDK, adding new platforms, and contributing to the project.
- **Reference**: Detailed API and platform documentation.
